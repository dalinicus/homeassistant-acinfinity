The below section applies to the 69 series of smart controllers.

- UIS Controller 69 Pro (CTR69P)
- UIS Controller 69 Pro+ (CTR69Q)

Controller entities will be created for each AC Infinity Controller on the configured user account.

Device entities will be created for each ***PORT*** on each UIS controller, even if no device is attached to a given port.  The UIS protocol is device type agnostic, so each port will be treated the same regardless of what is plugged (or not plugged) into it.
# Terms
- `Sensor`: A read-only measurement entity, such as temperature or humidity.
- `Control`: An entity that can change the operational state of devices, such as individual mode selections, triggers, and timer schedules.
- `Setting`: An entity that can change controller/device settings.  These correspond to fields found in the Settings section of the Android/iOS app.

# Controller Sensors
Read-Only sensors reported from the controller
- `Status`: Indicates if the controller is on and communicating with the AC Infinity API
- `Air Temperature`: The air temperature as reported by the air probe.
- `Humidity`: The humidity as reported by the air probe.
- `Vaper Pressure Deficit (VPD)`: Calculated VPD based on air probe temperature and humidity readings.

# Controller Settings
These entities correspond to fields found in the `Controller` tab of the device settings in the AC Infinity App.

## Sensor / VPD Calibration

- `Calibrate Temperature`:  Adjusts the temperature reading from the sensor probe, up to ±10C or ±20F
- `Calibrate Humidity`:  Adjusts the humidity reading from the sensor probe, up to ±10%
- `VPD Leaf Temperature Offset`:  Adjusts the leaf temperature in VPD calculation, up to ±10C or ±20F

<sub>
Note: If the preferred unit of temperature is changed on the UIS Controller, a reboot of Home Assistant is required to
update the user interface controls with the correct min/max values.  That being said, these fields should still continue
to function correctly when interfacing with the UIS API, even without a reboot.
</sub>

## Outside Climate

- `Outside Temperature`: Sets whether the exterior temperature is neutral to, higher, or lower than your interior space.
- `Outside Humidity`: Sets whether the exterior humidity is neutral to, higher, or lower than your interior space.

# Device Settings
These entities correspond to fields found in the `Port` tab of the device settings in the AC Infinity App.

- `Device Type`: The type of device plugged into the port (i.e. Fan, Grow Lights, etc... )
- `On Speed`: The device will run at this level when triggered ON
- `Off Speed`: The device will run at this level even when triggered OFF

## Dynamic Response

The dynamic response type can be changed via the `Dynamic Response` setting.
- `Transition`: UIS Devices will ramp up in levels when trigger to run in AUTO and VPD Modes (see Device Controls section below).  Set a transition threshold X.  For every multiple of X that the probe temperature, humidity and VPD has surpassed your trigger points, the UIS Device will increase by one level.
- `Buffer`: UIS and Outlet Devices will have a gap created on their temperature, humidity, and VPD triggers to prevent devices from turning on and off too frequently.

### Transition Mode
- `Transition Temperature`: Set a transition threshold X.  For every multiple of X that the probe temperature has surpassed your trigger points, the UIS Device will increase by one level.
- `Transition Humidity`: Set a transition threshold X.  For every multiple of X that the probe humidity has surpassed your trigger points, the UIS Device will increase by one level.
- `Transition VPD`: Set a transition threshold X.  For every multiple of X that the probe VPD has surpassed your trigger points, the UIS Device will increase by one level.

### Buffer Mode

- `Buffer Temperature`: Set a buffer X. Triggers won't deactivate until the temperature falls X degrees below the trigger temperature for high triggers, or X degrees above the trigger temperature for low triggers.
- `Buffer Humidity`: Set a buffer X. Triggers won't deactivate until the humidity falls X percentage points below the trigger humidity for high triggers, or X percentage points above the trigger humidity for low triggers.
- `Buffer VPD`: Set a buffer X. Triggers won't deactivate until the VPD falls X kPa below the trigger VPD for high triggers, or X kPa above the trigger VPD for low triggers.

## Sunrise / Sunset Duration
Only valid for Grow Light devices operating in `Cycle` or `Schedule` mode.

- `Sunrise/Sunset Enabled`: Enables or disables simulating the sun when transitioning the light between on and off states.
- `Sunrise/Sunset Minute`: Sets the time it will take to fully brighten or dim your grow lights to simulate the sun.

# Device Sensors
Read-Only sensors reported from each device
- `Status`: Indicates if a device plugged in and active on that port
- `State`: Indicates if the device is following the `On Power` or `Off Power` setting
- `Power`: Current power of the device, governed by the `On Power` and `Off Power` settings
- `Remaining Time`: Number of seconds until the next state change when using timer or schedule based modes.
- `Next State Change`: The timestamp of the next state change when using timer or schedule based modes, calculated based on the controller's configured time zone.

# Device Controls
Read/Write controls that define if a device runs in an ON or OFF state.  Each control is associated to a mode, and is only relevant when the device is operating in that mode.

The mode can be changed via the `Active Mode` control, which provides the following options.
- `On`: Device is always set to the on speed
- `Off`: Device is always set to the off speed
- `Auto`: Device toggled based on temperature and/or humidity triggers
- `Timer to On`: Device is turned on after a set duration
- `Timer to Off`: Device is turned off after a set duration
- `Cycle`: Device is toggled after set intervals
- `Schedule`: Device is toggled based on a schedule
- `VPD`: Device is toggled based on VPD triggers

## Global
These settings control the power level of a device when in a given trigger state, which is shared across all modes.
- `On Power`: Go to OFF MODE to set. The device will run at this level when triggered ON
- `Off Power`: Go to ON MODE to set.  The device will run at this level even when triggered OFF

## On Mode
Device is always set to the on speed . This mode has no unique controls.

## Off Mode
Device is always set to the off speed . This mode has no unique controls.

## Auto Mode
Device toggled based on temperature and/or humidity triggers.  This mode is split into two sub modes: Auto and Target.

- `Auto Settings Mode`: Swap between `Auto` and `Target` setting mode types.  `Target` mode is not valid for some device types.
